# EDAProjects: 
Here i have done Exploratory Data Analysis on certain datasets. Where we can analysis the data, check for whitespaces, outliers and other anomalies and do concern process to produce a clean data to build a model for ML process.
Exploratory Data Analysis is done to find certan anomalies:
Finding null values
finding Duplicates
Exploring about Numerical Variables
Exploring about the Categorical Variables
Finding Relationship between Features.
And Visualization of Datas to find the Outliers.
